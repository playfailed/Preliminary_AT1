<h1>Factorising</h1>
<p>To solve quadratic equations through factorization, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Identify the Quadratic Equation: <br>
        A quadratic equation is in the form (ax^2 + bx + c = 0), 
    </li>
    <li>Factor the Equation: <br>
        Look for two numbers that multiply to (ac) and add to (b).
    </li>
    <li>Set Each Factor Equal to Zero: <br>
        Once you have the factors, set each factor equal to zero and solve for (x). <br>
        This gives you the solutions to the quadratic equation.
    </li>
    <li>Verify the Solutions: <br>
        Substitute each solution back into the original equation to verify that it is indeed a solution.

<ol>
    <li>Identify the Quadratic Equation: <br>
        x<sup>2</sup> - 7x + 12 = 0. <br>
        a = 1, <br>
        b = -8,  <br>
        c = 12.  <br>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Factor the Equation: <br>
        Look for two numbers that multiply to ac and add to b. <br>
        -3 * -4 = 12 (ac), <br>
        -3 + -4 = -7 (b), <br>
        Hence, the Factor form would be (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Set Each Factor Equal to Zero: <br>
        Solve for x through the null factor law which is [ab = 0] either a or b is 0. <br>
        <br>
        x - 3 = 0. <br>
        x = 3 <br>
        <br>
        x - 4 = 0. <br>
        x = 4 <br>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Verify the Solutions: <br>
        Substitute each solution back into the original equation to verify that it is indeed a solution. <br>
        <br>
        (3)<sup>2</sup> - 7 * (3) + 12 = 0,  <br>
        9 - 21 + 12 = 0, <br>
        0 = 0. <br>
        <br>
        (4)<sup>2</sup> - 7 * (4) + 12 = 0,  <br>
        16 - 28 + 12 = 0, <br>
        0 = 0.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Hence, the solutions to the quadratic equation x<sup>2</sup> - 7x + 12 = 0 are x = 2 and x = 6.</p>

<p>Here is another Example.</p>
<p>Solve the factorise and solve the equation: 4x<sup>2</sup> - 9  </p>

<ol>
    <li>Identify the Quadratic Equation: <br>
        4x<sup>2</sup> - 9. <br>
        a = 4, <br>
        b = 0,  <br>
        c = -9.  <br>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Factor the Equation: <br>
        Look for two numbers that multiply to ac and add to b. <br>
        However there are no solutions via this method so we will have to have use the differences of square to factorise our expression.  <br>
        Using a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup> = (a + b)(a - b): <br> 
        <br>
        a<sup>2</sup> = (2x)<sup>2</sup>, <br>
        a = 2x, <br>
        <br>
        b<sup>2</sup> = (3)<sup>2</sup>, <br>
        b = 3, <br>
        <br>
        Hence, the Factor form would be (2x + 3)(2x - 3).
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Set Each Factor Equal to Zero: <br>
        (2x + 3)(2x - 3) = 0. <br>
        <br>
        Solve for x through the null factor law which is [ab = 0] either a or b is 0. <br>
        <br>
        2x - 3 = 0. <br>
        2x = 3 <br>
        x = <fraction><numerator>3</numerator><denominator>2</denominator></fraction>
        <br>
        2x + 3 = 0. <br>
        2x = -3 <br>
        x = -<fraction><numerator>3</numerator><denominator>2</denominator></fraction>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>Verify the Solutions: <br>
        Substitute each solution back into the original equation to verify that it is indeed a solution. <br>
        <br>
        4 * (<fraction><numerator>3</numerator><denominator>2</denominator></fraction>)<sup>2</sup> - 9 = 0,  <br>
        4 * (<fraction><numerator>9</numerator><denominator>4</denominator></fraction>) - 9 = 0,  <br>
        9 - 9 = 0,  <br>
        0 = 0. <br>
        <br>
        4 * (-<fraction><numerator>9</numerator><denominator>4</denominator></fraction>)<sup>2</sup> - 9 = 0,  <br>
        4 * (<fraction><numerator>9</numerator><denominator>4</denominator></fraction>) - 9 = 0,  <br>
        9 - 9 = 0,  <br>
        0 = 0. <br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>Hence, the solutions to the quadratic equation 4x<sup>2</sup> - 9 = 0 are x = Â±<fraction><numerator>3</numerator><denominator>2</denominator></fraction>.</p>

=======
    Step 1: Identify the Quadratic Equation
    The given equation is (x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0).
    
    Step 2: Factor the Equation
    To factor the equation, we look for two numbers that multiply to (12) (the constant term) and add to (-7) (the coefficient of (x)). The numbers that satisfy these conditions are (-2) and (-6).
    
    So, the equation can be factored as:
    
    [x^2 - 7x + 12 = (x - 2)(x - 6)]
    
    Step 3: Set Each Factor Equal to Zero
    Now, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for (x):
    
    For (x - 2 = 0), we find (x = 2).
    For (x - 6 = 0), we find (x = 6).
    Step 4: Verify the Solutions
    To verify these solutions, we substitute (x = 2) and (x = 6) back into the original equation:
    
    For (x = 2), (2^2 - 7(2) + 12 = 4 - 14 + 12 = 0), which confirms (x = 2) is a solution.
    For (x = 6), (6^2 - 7(6) + 12 = 36 - 42 + 12 = 0), which confirms (x = 6) is a solution.
    Conclusion
    The solutions to the quadratic equation (x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0) are (x = 2) and (x = 6).
